To run this program, enter the following on the command line:
-------
$ make
$ time ./p4 'inputSize' 'algorithm'
-------

'inputSize' == the amount of lines you desire to read in from file. 
'algorithm' == desired algorithm you want to use for sort.

Algorithm options (MUST BE ENTERED IN LOWER CASE): 
'is' == insertion sort
'ms' == merge sort
'ss' == selection sort
'qs' == quick sort

For example, to read in 20,000 lines from the file using merge sort, I would type the following on the command line:
$ time ./p4 20000 ms
